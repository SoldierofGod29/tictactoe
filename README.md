# tictactoe

This is a tic tac toe game that I made to help me learn more about using constructors, modules, and factory functions.
This project is a simple tic tac toe game that allows a player to choose X or O and play a computer. If the player wins
a display says "you win", if the computer wins a display pops up saying "you lose", and if it's a tie a display pop up to
say "it's a draw". It will also allow a player to add their name,and a button to restart or start the game.
